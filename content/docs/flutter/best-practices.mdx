# Prepare Yourself for the Perfect Mobile Developer

> **Note:**
  **What exactly do you need to become a better mobile developer?**

  Learn the essential skills and practices to become a professional mobile developer.

---

## Introduction

In this guide, we will discuss how to prepare yourself for mobile development.

In mobile development, everyone wants to create a user-friendly application that is good in criteria of code structure, stability, and well-formatted.

This means the application should contain all the things that are appreciated by everyone - your clients, your office colleagues, your boss, and mainly yourself.

For this, you not only need to write code, but this code needs to be proper and well-structured.

> **Note:**
So, what exactly is needed for this? Let's explore the 4 essential pillars of becoming a great mobile developer.

---

## 1. Proper Format (MVVM, MVC, REDUX) Structure (Architecture)

### The Junior Developer Mindset

In the stage of a junior developer (or maybe even earlier), we think about: **"Why do we need to follow this structure if our application works without it?"**

But...

I know without knowing these patterns, we are fearful about concepts like MVC, MVVM, and all these architectural patterns.

### Getting Started with Architecture

> **Note:**
If you are a beginner, start with **MVC** and then move to **MVVM**.

### Personal Experience

Me, I was (4 years ago) did not like this MVVM Structure, because at that time of learning this structure, it looked so complicated and boring.

**But** after learning and applying this structure to my applications, it worked like a charm!

### Benefits of Proper Architecture

- **Better Formatted Code**: After applying architecture patterns, my code became much better formatted
- **Scalability**: After adding functionality month by month, the project became large
- **Maintainability**: The project remained well-formatted and easy to understand for my seniors and mainly for me ☺

### Common Architecture Patterns

#### MVC (Model-View-Controller)

The MVC pattern separates your application into three main components:
- **Model**: Handles data and business logic
- **View**: Displays the user interface
- **Controller**: Manages the communication between Model and View

#### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

MVVM is an evolution of MVC that provides better separation of concerns:
- **Model**: Data and business logic
- **View**: User interface
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between Model and View, handling UI logic

#### Redux

Redux provides predictable state management:
- Single source of truth (Store)
- State is read-only
- Changes are made through pure functions (Reducers)

## 2. Testing (Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Functionality Testing, etc)

### Why Testing Matters

As we all know, testing is an important point for developers (not just mobile, but web and all platforms).

> **Note:**
I am not talking here about Tester (QA). This testing is for developers - testing that is needed in our coding.

### Major Testing Categories

Testing is divided into some major categories:

1. **Unit Testing**
2. **Integration Testing**
3. **Functionality Testing**
4. **Performance Testing**
5. **User Interface Testing**

Also, there are some more testing types: smoke testing, alpha testing, system testing, stress testing, regression testing, etc.

### Let's Talk About Each Type

#### 1. Unit Testing

**In simple words**: Unit testing is to test each component or module of your software project.

It means they test small things like:
- Your if-else conditions
- Small operations like arithmetic and logical operations

```dart
// Example Unit Test in Flutter
test('Counter increments', () {
  final counter = Counter();
  counter.increment();
  expect(counter.value, 1);
});
```

#### 2. Integration Testing

This testing is focused on what output is produced after unit testing.

**In simple words**: They check the internal mechanisms of output.

```dart
// Example Integration Test
testWidgets('Counter increments smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());

  expect(find.text('0'), findsOneWidget);
  expect(find.text('1'), findsNothing);

  await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.add));
  await tester.pump();

  expect(find.text('0'), findsNothing);
  expect(find.text('1'), findsOneWidget);
});
```

#### 3. Functionality Testing

This type of testing checks if the system performs or behaves as per requirements or not.

**Key aspects**:
- Does the feature work as expected?
- Does it meet business requirements?
- Are all user flows working correctly?

#### 4. Performance Testing

This type of testing measures your project's:
- Performance
- Speed
- Network stability
- All factors required for better performance

**What to measure**:
- App startup time
- Screen render time
- Memory usage
- Network response time
- Battery consumption

#### 5. User Interface Testing

This testing checks how your project performs in the graphical user interface, or we can say it's responsive design.

**In simple words**: How it performs on live devices, because there are various sizes and screen densities. We need our project to perform well everywhere.

I think you understand what I want to say.

## 3. Aware of Current Technology Updates

### The Importance of Staying Updated

Please let me be clear: I think that every time, it doesn't matter what skills you have or how much experience you've.

> **Note:**
(I don't say experience doesn't matter - experience matters more, especially when you face new challenges)

Everyone judges you for your **current knowledge** - meaning how much you are updated.

### What You Need to Know

- **Current OS Version**: What is the current Android/iOS version?
- **Advantages & Disadvantages**: Know the pros and cons of each version
- **Developer Challenges**: What problems will developers face with this new version?
- **Solutions**: How to deal with these challenges?

### How to Stay Updated

#### Follow the Right Sources

For these things, you should:
- Follow your technology-related experts
- Mainly follow OS-related companies like **Google** and **Apple**
- Understand what they work on and their actual plans

#### Attend Events

- **Seminars**: Online or offline (attend what's possible for you)
- **Meet-ups**: Join local developer communities
- **Conferences**: Attend major tech conferences

> **Note:**
This helps you a lot in acknowledging and being aware of new updates.

### Recommended Resources

- **Google I/O**: Annual developer conference by Google
- **WWDC**: Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference
- **Flutter Engage**: Flutter-specific announcements
- **Medium & Dev.to**: Tech articles and tutorials
- **GitHub**: Follow trending repositories
- **Twitter/X**: Follow Flutter and Dart teams

## 4. Always Train Yourself for DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

### Why DSA is Important

We all know this is a very interesting topic for every developer.

During interviews, it is mostly highlighted.

> **Note:**
No one is perfect at this, and everyone wants to be a perfectionist.

### But Why?

The reason is: **Every great application depends on how it works perfectly with user requirements.**

For these requirements, we (developers) write great logic that fulfills the requirements of the application with proper code.

### Real-World Example

Because of every sort of collection data, we need to filter based on requirements.

**For example**:

If we have 1,000 user data entries, we need to separate this data by:
- Age criteria
- Gender criteria
- Location criteria
- Any other filters

### What We Do

We write logic, and this logic analyzes how we will filter in terms of:
- **Time Complexity**: How fast the algorithm runs
- **Space Complexity**: How much memory it uses

### Understanding DSA

> **Note:**
**Data Structure** is like a named location (where you store your data).

**Algorithm** is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.

Learning data structures and algorithms allows us to write:
- ✅ Efficient code
- ✅ Well-structured code
- ✅ Optimized programming

### Common Data Structures

1. **Arrays/Lists**: Ordered collection of elements
2. **Maps/HashMaps**: Key-value pairs
3. **Sets**: Unique elements collection
4. **Stacks**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
5. **Queues**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
6. **Trees**: Hierarchical data structure
7. **Graphs**: Network of nodes and edges

### Algorithm Categories

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort
2. **Search Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Optimization problems
4. **Greedy Algorithms**: Making locally optimal choices
5. **Recursion**: Function calling itself
6. **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's

### Example in Flutter

```dart
// Example: Filtering a list of users by age
class User {
  final String name;
  final int age;
  final String gender;

  User(this.name, this.age, this.gender);
}

List<User> filterUsersByAge(List<User> users, int minAge, int maxAge) {
  // Time Complexity: O(n)
  // Space Complexity: O(n)
  return users.where((user) =>
    user.age >= minAge && user.age <= maxAge
  ).toList();
}

List<User> sortUsersByAge(List<User> users) {
  // Time Complexity: O(n log n)
  // Space Complexity: O(n)
  users.sort((a, b) => a.age.compareTo(b.age));
  return users;
}
```
