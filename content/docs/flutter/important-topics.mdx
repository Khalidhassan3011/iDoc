## 5. State Management

### Overview

Managing the state of an app's widgets is an essential part of Flutter development, so an interviewer might ask you about various state management techniques in Flutter, such as setState(), Provider, and Bloc.

State management refers to how an application manages and updates its data over time. When a user interacts with a Flutter app, the app's state can change, and the UI needs to update accordingly.

### State Management Options

Flutter offers several options for managing state, including setState, Provider, BLoC, and Redux. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which to use depends on the complexity of the app and the developer's preference.

#### setState

setState is the most straightforward option for managing state in Flutter. It allows you to update the state of a widget and rebuild its UI. However, as an app grows in complexity, setState can become unwieldy and hard to manage.

#### Provider

Provider is a state management library that helps to simplify the process of passing data between widgets. It provides a simple way to manage app-wide state and can be used in conjunction with setState for more complex scenarios.

#### BLoC (Business Logic Component)

BLoC is a design pattern that separates the app's logic from its UI. It involves creating a separate class that handles the business logic of an app and communicates with the UI via Streams or ChangeNotifiers.

#### Redux

Redux is a state management library that provides a predictable way to manage the state in an app. It involves storing the app's state in a central store and dispatching actions to update that state.
